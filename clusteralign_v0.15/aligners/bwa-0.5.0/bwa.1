.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
BWA is a fast light-weighted tool that aligns relatively short sequences
(queries) to a sequence database (targe), such as the human reference
genome. It implements two different algorithms, both based on
Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). The first algorithm is designed for
short queries up to ~200bp with low error rate (<3%). It does gapped
global alignment w.r.t. queries, supports paired-end reads, and is one
of the fastest short read alignment algorithms to date while also
visiting suboptimal hits. The second algorithm, dBWT-SW, is designed for
long reads with more errors. It performs heuristic Smith-Waterman-like
alignment to find high-scoring local hits (and thus chimera). On
low-error short queries, dBWT-SW is slower and less accurate than the
first algorithm, but on long queries, it is better.
.PP
For both algorithms, the database file in the FASTA format must be
first indexed with the
.B `index'
command, which typically takes a few hours. The first algorithm is
implemented via the
.B `aln'
command, which finds the suffix array (SA) coordinates of good hits of
each individual read, and the
.B `samse/sampe'
command, which converts SA coordinates to chromosomal coordinate and
pairs reads (for `sampe'). The second algorithm is invoked by the
.B `dbtwsw'
command. It works for single-end reads only.

.SH COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
.TP
.B index
bwa index [-p prefix] [-a algoType] [-c] <in.db.fasta>

Index database sequences in the FASTA format.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 10
.B -c

.TP
.B -p STR
Prefix of the output database [same as db filename]
.TP
.B -a STR
Algorithm for constructing BWT index. Available options are:
.RS
.TP
.B is
IS linear-time algorithm for constructing suffix array. It requires
5.37N memory where N is the size of the database. IS is moderately fast,
but does not work with database larger than 2GB. IS is the default
algorithm due to its simplicity. The current codes for IS algorithm are
reimplemented by Yuta Mori.
.TP
.B bwtsw
Algorithm implemented in BWT-SW. This method works with the whole human
genome, but it does not work with database smaller than 10MB and it is
usually slower than IS.

[-O gapOsc] [-E gapEsc] <in.db.fasta> <in.query.fq> > <out.sai>

Find the SA coordinates of the input reads. Maximum
.I maxSeedDiff
differences are allowed in the first
.I seedLen
subsequence and maximum
.I maxDiff
differences are allowed in the whole sequence.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 10
.B -n NUM
Maximum edit distance if the value is INT, or the fraction of missing
alignments given 2% uniform base error rate if FLOAT. In the latter
case, the maximum edit distance is automatically chosen for different
read lengths. [0.04]
.TP

.B -e INT
Maximum number of gap extensions, -1 for k-difference mode (disallowing
long gaps) [-1]
.TP

Disallow a long deletion within INT bp towards the 3'-end [16]
.TP
.B -i INT
Disallow an indel within INT bp towards the ends [5]
.TP
.B -l INT
Take the first INT subsequence as seed. If INT is larger than the query
sequence, seeding will be disabled. For long reads, this option is
typically ranged from 25 to 35 for `-k 2'. [inf]
.TP
.B -k INT
Maximum edit distance in the seed [2]
.TP
.B -t INT

.B -O INT
Gap open penalty [11]
.TP
.B -E INT
Gap extension penalty [4]
.TP
.B -R INT
Proceed with suboptimal alignments if there are no more than INT equally
best hits. This option only affects paired-end mapping. Increasing this
threshold helps to improve the pairing accuracy at the cost of speed,
especially for short reads (~32bp).
.TP
.B -c
Reverse query but not complement it, which is required for alignment in
the color space.
.TP
.B -N
Disable iterative search. All hits with no more than
.I maxDiff
differences will be found. This mode is much slower than the default.
.RE

.TP
.B samse
bwa samse [-n maxOcc] <in.db.fasta> <in.sai> <in.fq> > <out.sam>

Generate alignments in the SAM format given single-end reads. Repetitive
hits will be randomly chosen. When
.B -n
is applied, multiple positions will be printed in a concise format. The
`>' line in the output shows the read name, the number of printed hits
and the number of stored hits; the following lines give the chromosomal
coordinates and the edit distance.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 10
.B -n INT
Output up to INT top hits. Value -1 to disable outputting multiple
hits. [-1]
.RE

Generate alignments in the SAM format given paired-end reads. Repetitive
read pairs will be placed randomly.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 8
.B -a INT

properly. Since 0.4.5, this option is only used when there are not
enough good alignment to infer the distribution of insert sizes. [500]
.TP
.B -o INT
Maximum occurrences of a read for pairing. A read with more occurrneces
will be treated as a single-end read. Reducing this parameter helps
faster pairing. [100000]

Maximum SA interval size for initiating an HSP. Higher -s increases
accuracy at the cost of speed. [3]

.SH NOTES ON SHORT-READ ALIGNMENT
.SS Alignment Accuracy
.PP
When seeding is disabled, BWA guarantees to find an alignment
containing maximum
.I maxDiff
differences including
.I maxGapO
gap opens which do not occur within
.I nIndelEnd
bp towards either end of the query. Longer gaps may be found if
.I maxGapE
is positive, but it is not guaranteed to find all hits. When seeding is
enabled, BWA further requires that the first
.I seedLen
subsequence contains no more than
.I maxSeedDiff
differences.
.PP
When gapped alignment is disabled, BWA is expected to generate the same
alignment as Eland, the Illumina alignment program. However, as BWA
change `N' in the database sequence to random nucleotides, hits to these
random sequences will also be counted. As a consequence, BWA may mark a
unique hit as a repeat, if the random sequences happen to be identical
to the sequences which should be unqiue in the database. This random
behaviour will be avoided in future releases.
.PP
By default, if the best hit is no so repetitive (controlled by -R), BWA
also finds all hits contains one more mismatch; otherwise, BWA finds all
equally best hits only. Base quality is NOT considered in evaluating
hits. In pairing, BWA searches, among the found hits under the
constraint of the
.I maxOcc
option, for pairs within
.I maxInsSize
and with proper orientation.

.SS Memory Requirement
.PP
With bwtsw algorithm, 2.5GB memory is required for indexing the complete
human genome sequences. For short reads, the
.B `aln'
command uses ~2.3GB memory and the
.B `sampe'
command uses ~3.5GB.

.SS Speed
.PP
Indexing the human genome sequences takes 3 hours with bwtsw
algorithm. Indexing smaller genomes with IS or divsufsort algorithms is
several times faster, but requires more memory.
.PP
Speed of alignment is largely determined by the error rate of the query
sequences (r). Firstly, BWA runs much faster for near perfect hits than
for hits with many differences, and it stops searching for a hit with
l+2 differences if a l-difference hit is found. This means BWA will be
very slow if r is high because in this case BWA has to visit hits with
many differences and looking for these hits is expensive. Secondly, the
alignment algorithm behind makes the speed sensitive to [k log(N)/m],
where k is the maximum allowed differences, N the size of database and m
the length of a query. In practice, we choose k w.r.t. r and therefore r
is the leading factor. I would not recommend to use BWA on data with
r>0.02.
.PP
Pairing is slower for shorter reads. This is mainly because shorter
reads have more spurious hits and converting SA coordinates to
chromosomal coordinates are very costly.
.PP
In a practical experiment, BWA is able to map 2 million 32bp reads to a
bacterial genome in several minutes, map the same amount of reads to
human X chromosome in 8-15 minutes and to the human genome in 15-25
minutes. This result implies that the speed of BWA is insensitive to the
size of database and therefore BWA is more efficient when the database
is sufficiently large. On smaller genomes, hash based algorithms are
usually much faster.

.SH NOTES ON LONG-READ ALIGNMENT
.PP
Command
.B `dbwtsw'
is designed for long-read alignment. The algorithm behind, dBWT-SW, is
similar to BWT-SW, but does not guarantee to find all local hits due to
the heuristic acceleration. It tends to be faster and more accurate if
the resultant alignment is supported by more high-scoring segments pairs
(HSPs), and therefore dBWT-SW usually performs better on long queries
than on short ones.

On 350-1000bp reads, dBWT-SW is several to tens of times faster than the
existing programs. Its accuracy is comparable to SSAHA2, more accurate
than BLAT. Like BLAT, dBWT-SW also finds chimera which may pose a
challenge to SSAHA2. On 10-100kbp queries where chimera detection is
important, dBWT-SW is over 10X faster than BLAT while being more
sensitive.

DBWT-SW can also be used to align ~100bp reads, but it is slower than
the short-read algorithm. Its sensitivity and accuracy is lower than
SSAHA2 especially when the sequencing error rate is above 2%. This is
the trade-off of the 30X speed up in comparison to SSAHA2's -454 mode.

.SH HISTORY
BWA is largely influenced by BWT-SW. It uses source codes from BWT-SW
and mimics its binary file formats; dBWT-SW resembles BWT-SW in several
ways. The initial idea about BWT-based alignment also came from the
group who developed BWT-SW. At the same time, BWA is different enough
from BWT-SW. The short-read alignment algorithm bears no similarity to
Smith-Waterman algorithm any more. While dBWT-SW learns from BWT-SW, it
introduces heuristics that can hardly be applied to the original
algorithm. In all, BWA does not guarantee to find all local hits as what
BWT-SW is designed to do, but it is much faster than BWT-SW on both
short and long query sequences.

I started to write the first piece of codes on 24 May 2008 and got the
initial stable version on 02 June 2008. During this period, I was
acquainted that Professor Tak-Wah Lam, the first author of BWT-SW paper,
was collaborating with Beijing Genomics Institute on SOAP2, the successor
to SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package). SOAP2 has come out in
November 2008. According to the SourceForge download page, the third
BWT-based short read aligner, bowtie, was first released in August
2008. At the time of writing this manual, at least three more BWT-based
short-read aligners are being implemented.

The dBWT-SW algorithm is a new component of BWA. It was conceived in
November 2008 and implemented ten months later.
