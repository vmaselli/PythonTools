0) There should be a 'shrimp' script in the root directory that wraps all
   sorts of functionality and generally makes things very trivial to use.
1) There is some code duplication, for instance in fasta parsers.
2) The fasta parsing code is doubtlessly going to choke on some slightly
   different formats someday.
3) str* operations are often not done safely. We should add local strl*
   functions and use them.
4) Many outputs could probably benefit from spacing parameters to printf,
   rather than inserting spaces in the code.
5) Pre-calculate and cache translations of reads, so as not to do them over
   again for each S-W call. This may improve CS vectored performance a fair bit.
6) Fix the for-loop spaced seed compressor so it scales.
7) Fix time calculations (and perhaps errors) when -n is large (e.g. 222).
8) Add an optional S-W score threshold to prettyprint.
9) Build a regression test harness.
A) Handle Solexa read formats, or package a python utility to convert to fasta.
