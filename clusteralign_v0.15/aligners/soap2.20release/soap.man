       SOAPaligner/soap2 is a member of the SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analy-
       sis Package). It is an updated  version  of  SOAP  software  for  short
       oligonucleotide  alignment.  The new program features in super fast and
       accurate alignment for huge amounts of short reads generated  by  Illu-
       mina/Solexa  Genome  Analyzer.  Compared to soap v1, it is one order of
       magnitude faster. It require only 2 minutes aligning one  million  sin-
       gle-end  reads  onto  the  human  reference  genome. Another remarkable
       improvement of SOAPaligner is that it now supports a wide range of  the
       read length.

       SOAPaligner  benefitted in time and space efficiency by a revolution in
       the basic data structures and algorithms used.The core  algorithms  and
       the indexing data structures (2way-BWT) are developed by the algorithms
       research group of the Department of Computer Science, the University of
       Hong Kong (T.W. Lam, Alan Tam, Simon Wong, Edward Wu and S.M. Yiu).

       Before use soap2 to do alignment, the reference index must be generated
       by 2bwt-builder.

              NNOOTTEE:: 1. the reference input should only be FASTA format; 2. the
              program wil auto generate the index files in the directory where
              the fasta file is located, so confirm the permission at first.

       The  datastructure  is imcompatible with 32bit, so it can't be migrated
       on any 32bit platforms.  Due to using the MMX instruction to  opitimize
       parts of code, the current version can only run on xx8866__6644 ppllaattffoorrmm..  We
       will provide a universal version for most of the 64bit platform  later.
